# Two Tables

## Purpose
This was an end of the chapter homework assignment designed to help solidify our understanding of using mysql and creating a connection with a seqelize database. We didnt do this in the bootcamp originally because as a class we were falling behind schedule so it was nice to get another crack at a project using sql.  

## Process
The assignment was pretty straight forward. The biggest learning curve was figurung out how to import to csv files into my database. Once this was done it was a simple matter of using inquirer to determine what the user wished to accomplish then writting the basic query functions to facilitate these requests.
